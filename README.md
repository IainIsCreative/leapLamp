# Description

The idea behind this work was to explore how to interface Arduino with Leapmotion, and to see what would be the precision we could get with some basic servos.

Everything is surprisingly smooth.

# How to run it
- Build the lamp!
- Upload the StandardFirmata to the Arduino (preferably version 2.2)
- Connect the Leapmotion and the Arduino
- Install dependencies `npm i`
- Run `npm start`
